    Andrew & Tim
        Long debugging phase with the Zigbees
        Baud Rate was changed to 38400 in order to communicate with the Zigbee 
        6X multiplier applied to PLL (9X multiplier applied to Botao wasn't working)
        Optical Flow is doing the XYZ
        Zigbee communication interferes with communication  of the Optical Flow (57600)
        ***Problem is communication can only be established with Zigbee OR Optical Flow.
        Ask Professor Wilt for advice
        Optical Flow only uses RX on UART1
        *Why is there a PLL Multiplier*
        *Why is the optical flow wired the way it is*
        Wiring issues when the fram was moved? Maybe that's the source of all our issues.
    Phil
        Went through and edited the CalState and CalibrationControl to edit out all the motion capture
        Will apply myself to other areas that need help.
    Courtney & Patrick
        Recomendation Optical Flow to I2C instead of UART
        Take a step back and redo the entire thing to fix these issues.
        Sort out the Github-Patrick
        Optical Flow was flashed with some Opensource Github File. 
        Reflash the Optical flow ***https://docs.px4.io/en/sensor/px4flow.html***
            Optical Flow sensor needs to be hooked into computer via usb to be reflashed.
Goals
    Andrew & Tim
        Check to see if Optical Flow is flashed
        Talk to People to see if baud rate mismatch between Optical Flow and Zigbees
        Explore I2C for Optical Flow sensor
    Phil
        Meet with Andrew and Tim
        Finding Replacements
        Comment things in the Main.
    Courtney
        Will drop by to see if the Optical Flow Lens is focused (When Andrew and Tim meet)
    Patrick
        Work on the GitHub files that weren't brought over successfully
        Documentation
            Wiring
            Hardware Set-Up
            Soft-ware 
            Quick user guide to flashing and quick start up
        Drop by one of Andrew and Tim's Sessions to check that everything is set up correctly
